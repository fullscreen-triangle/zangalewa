# Pugachev Cobra: Finite Observer AI Validation

A VS Code extension implementing finite observer validation systems for AI-generated content based on consciousness-aware mathematical principles.

## Overview

Pugachev Cobra prevents AI validation failures through systematic bias and bounded processing, eliminating infinite regress and observer-reality collapse that causes traditional AI safety systems to fail.

## Features

- **Finite Observer Processing**: Implements systematic bias for functional AI validation
- **Context-Aware Validation**: Adapts validation criteria based on problem type analysis  
- **Consciousness-Based Assessment**: Self-validation through systematic self-interrogation
- **Bounded Task Processing**: Terminates analysis before infinite regress
- **Meta-Knowledge Integration**: Understands problem types to generate appropriate systematic bias

## Installation

1. Install from VS Code marketplace (coming soon)
2. Or install from VSIX: `code --install-extension pugachev-cobra-0.1.0.vsix`

## Configuration

Configure validation parameters in VS Code settings:

```json
{
  "pugachev-cobra.consciousnessThreshold": 0.6,
  "pugachev-cobra.systematicBias": {
    "professionalCommunication": {
      "factualAccuracy": 0.9,
      "conservativeTone": 0.8,
      "verifiability": 0.9
    },
    "creativeExploration": {
      "novelty": 0.7,
      "logicalConsistency": 0.6,
      "theoreticalRigor": 0.8
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage

- **Validate Selection**: Right-click selected text → "Validate Selection with Finite Observer"
- **Validate Document**: Command palette → "Pugachev Cobra: Validate Entire Document"  
- **Configure Context**: Set problem type for appropriate systematic bias

## Theoretical Foundation

Based on rigorous mathematical proofs establishing:
- Infinite validation impossibility for finite systems
- Selection bias necessity for functional observation
- Meta-knowledge requirements for context-appropriate validation
- Termination criteria necessity for bounded processing
