# Change Log

## [0.1.0] - 2024-12-XX

### Added
- Initial release of Pugachev Cobra VS Code extension
- Finite observer validation system implementation
- Consciousness-based AI validation with systematic bias
- Context-aware problem analysis and bias generation
- Bounded processing with termination criteria
- Specialized task processors for different validation types
- Real-time validation diagnostics and feedback
- Support for multiple problem contexts (Professional Communication, Creative Exploration, Technical Analysis, Academic Writing)
- Meta-knowledge processing for context refinement
- Integration with VS Code's diagnostic system

### Features
- **Finite Observer Processing**: Implements systematic bias for functional AI validation
- **Context-Aware Validation**: Adapts validation criteria based on problem type analysis
- **Consciousness-Based Assessment**: Self-validation through systematic self-interrogation
- **Bounded Task Processing**: Terminates analysis before infinite regress
- **Professional Communication Focus**: Specialized validation for job applications, cover letters, and professional documents
- **Overconfidence Detection**: Advanced detection of overconfident language and unsupported claims
- **Tone Analysis**: Context-appropriate tone and formality assessment
- **Real-time Diagnostics**: Integration with VS Code's Problems panel

### Technical Implementation
- TypeScript-based VS Code extension
- Mathematical framework based on finite observer principles
- Systematic bias generation with context-dependent configurations
- Task decomposition with importance filtering
- Consciousness validation with "Aihwa, ndini ndadaro" principle
- Termination criteria preventing infinite processing
- Comprehensive type definitions for validation system components

### Configuration Options
- Consciousness threshold adjustment (Î¦ threshold)
- Systematic bias configuration for different contexts
- Termination criteria customization
- LLM provider selection and configuration
- Diagnostic display preferences
