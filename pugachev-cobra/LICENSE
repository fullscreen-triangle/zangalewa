This software implements the mathematical framework described in:
"Finite Observer Validation Systems: Mathematical Framework for Bounded Artificial Intelligence Processing"
by K.F. Sachikonye

The theoretical foundations are based on consciousness-aware computing principles and finite observer mathematics as part of the Zangalewa consciousness-based computing framework.
